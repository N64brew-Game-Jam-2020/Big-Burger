# Big Burger
A fast-paced homebrew arcade burger-stacking game for the N64.

## Building
Needs the N64 developer kit to compile.
First, run `mkdir build` to create a build directory.
Then, assuming everything is in its standard location, run `build.bat` to build the ROM.

## How to Play
The objective of Big Burger is to build the tallest burger you can.
The game is all about timing.
When the current ingredient lines up with your burger, press A to slap it into place.
The closer you get to the centre, the more points you're awarded.
If you are very far off, you will get a MISS, removing one life from your life counter.
Run out of lives, and you're done!
The game gets much more difficult as it goes on.
Can you reach level 1000?

## Special Thanks
There is absolutely no way I could've gotten anywhere in this project without the help and encouragement from the amazing N64Brew community.
